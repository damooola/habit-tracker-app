# Habit Tracker App

## Overview

The Habit Tracker App is a simple yet powerful tool to help users track their daily habits. It features a heatmap visualization, allowing users to see their progress over time. Users can add, edit, and delete habits, and they also have the option to switch between light and dark modes.

## Features

1. **Habit Management:**
   - Add new habits with customizable names.
   - Edit existing habits (including changing their names or descriptions).
   - Delete habits when they are no longer relevant.

2. **Heatmap Visualization:**
   - The heatmap provides an intuitive view of habit completion over days or weeks.
   - Each cell in the heatmap represents a day, and its color intensity reflects the habit's completion status (e.g., darker green for more task completed - think of the github ).

3. **Light and Dark Modes:**
   - Users can toggle between light mode (for daytime) and dark mode (for night time or low-light conditions).

## Technologies Used

- **Isar:** The local database for storing habit data.
- **Slideable:** For smooth swipe actions (e.g., edit & delete buttons).
- **Heatmap Calendar:** To create the heatmap visualization.
- **Provider:** For efficient state management of habits.
